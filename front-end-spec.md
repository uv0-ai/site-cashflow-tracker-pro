## **UI/UX Specification: Site CashFlow TrackerPro**

### **Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for **Site CashFlow TrackerPro**'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

  * **Overall UX Vision**: The core UX vision is to create a seamless experience for Project Managers in the field. The interface should be intuitive enough for a user with minimal technical experience to quickly and accurately input data. For Supervisors, the focus is on a clean dashboard that provides all necessary information at a glance without being cluttered.
  * **Key Interaction Paradigms**: The design will prioritize the mobile experience for Project Managers, as they will likely be entering data from their phones. Forms will be simplified with large tap targets. Data will be presented in a logical hierarchy, starting with a high-level overview for supervisors and allowing them to drill down into specific details.
  * **Core Screens and Views**:
      * Login/Authentication Screen
      * Project Manager Dashboard
      * Expense & Receipt Entry Forms
      * Supervisor Dashboard

    ```
  * **Navigation Structure**:
      * **Primary Navigation**: A top-level or side navigation menu for administrators and supervisors to move between main sections like "Dashboard," "Users," and "Sites."
      * **Secondary Navigation**: Contextual navigation within a main section, such as filtering options on the dashboard.
      * **Breadcrumb Strategy**: We will use a clear breadcrumb navigation path to help users understand their location within the application's hierarchy, particularly when drilling down into details from the main dashboard.

      * **Expense Entry Form**: A simple form with a clear flow for inputting data and a prominent area for the document upload.
      * **Project Manager Dashboard**: A streamlined version of the supervisor dashboard, showing data relevant only to the logged-in Project Manager's assigned site.

### **Component Library / Design System**

  * **Design System Approach**: We will use a component-based approach with a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS. This will allow for rapid prototyping and ensure consistency across the application.
  * **Core Components**:
      * **Form Inputs**: Standardized text inputs, number fields, and dropdowns.
      * **Buttons**: A primary button for actions like "Submit" and secondary buttons for actions like "Cancel."
      * **Data Tables**: Reusable tables for displaying lists of expenses and receipts, with pagination and filtering capabilities.
      * **Dashboard Cards**: Standardized card components for displaying key metrics on the dashboard.

-----

### **Branding & Style Guide**

  * **Visual Identity**: The application will have a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic.
  * **Color Palette**: A professional color palette will be used, with distinct colors for success, warning, and error states to provide clear user feedback.
  * **Typography**: A legible, professional font family will be chosen for all text.
  * **Spacing & Layout**: The design will use a consistent spacing scale and a responsive grid system.

-----

### **Accessibility Requirements**

We will prioritize accessibility from the beginning to ensure the application is usable by all users.

  * **Compliance Target**: WCAG AA standards.
  * **Key Requirements**:
      * **Visual**: Clear color contrast ratios and legible font sizes.
      * **Interaction**: Full keyboard navigation support and accessible form labels.
      * **Content**: Meaningful alternative text for all images and documents.
